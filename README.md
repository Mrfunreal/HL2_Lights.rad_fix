# HL2_Lights.rad_fix
Two new lights.rad files to make proper shadows for all models.

Bigger_lights.rad contains only models named "Fence" and "Foliage"
HUGE_Lights.rad contains every single model from HL1, HL2, EP1, EP2 and Lost Coast.

Keep in mind, it will only compile proper texture shadows if the model is a static prop that has translucent materials.

How to use them is described [on this Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3406090419)
